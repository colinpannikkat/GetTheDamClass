# GetTheDamClass

Class vacancy notifier Chrome extension for Oregon State University.

We have a backend server running on a private VPS to track course vacancies and alert students. The backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/aj-arts/GetTheDamClass-Backend).

## Build Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

To install all node packages first run:

#### `npm install`

Then, in the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run build`

Which builds the extension to the `dist` folder, which you can then load into your browser by going to `chrome://extensions` and clicking `Load unpacked`, which you can then load the build and use in your browser.
